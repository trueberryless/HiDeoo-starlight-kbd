Starlight Kbd supports a simple syntax for documenting keyboard shortcuts.
This guide describes the format supported by the [`<Kbd>`](/components/kbd/) component and recommended practices.

## Shortcuts

A basic shortcut consists of one or more modifier keys followed by a regular key, all connected with `+` signs.

<Preview>

```mdx
A shortcut with a single modifier key:

<Kbd mac="Command+S" windows="Control+S" />

A shortcut with multiple modifier keys:

<Kbd mac="Command+Shift+S" windows="Control+Shift+S" />
```

A shortcut with a single modifier key:

<Kbd mac="Command+S" windows="Control+S" linux="Control+S" />

A shortcut with multiple modifier keys:

<Kbd mac="Command+Shift+S" windows="Control+Shift+S" linux="Control+Shift+S" />

</Fragment>

## Chords

Some commands require a sequence of keyboard combinations, also known as chords.
These are represented by separating each combination with a space.

<Preview>

```mdx
Press some keys and then press some more keys:

<Kbd mac="Command+K Command+S" windows="Control+K Control+S" />
```

<Fragment slot="preview">

Press some keys and then press some more keys:

<Kbd mac="Command+K Command+S" windows="Control+K Control+S" linux="Control+K Control+S" />

</Fragment>

## Recommendations

When documenting keyboard shortcuts, consider these recommendations:

- Be consistent and use the same key names throughout your documentation.
  For example, stick to either `Control` or `Ctrl` but not both.

- Avoid glyphs and use text for modifier keys.
  For example, use `Command` instead of `⌘` which may not be obvious to all users.

  :::note[Did you know?]
  The Starlight Kbd plugin automatically expands common abbreviations for screen readers, e.g. the `⌘+K S` sequence is announced as "Command + K then S".
